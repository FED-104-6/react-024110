# React application using Vite <img src='public\vite.svg' style="width:30px; height:auto; vertical-align: -15%;">
Just for practice :) <br>

I'm doing some exercises which help me improve my front-end skills by using the official React site that Drew recommended us on Teams.

## ðŸš€ How to run
```bash
0. git clone <repo-url>
1. Install dependencies:
    npm install
2. Start the development server:
    npm run dev
3. Open the provided local URL in your browser.
    usually http://localhost:5173
```

## Exercise 01: Router, Forms, Lifting State Up
- React Router â†’ Implemented in App.jsx for navigation between pages.

- Forms â†’ Built a controlled form inside 07_DIY0911.jsx.

- Lifting State Up â†’ Shared parent state with props across most of the 7 page components.
