# React application using Vite <img src='public\vite.svg' style="width:30px; height:auto; vertical-align: -15%;">

This project is a collection of all the exercises and projects I worked on during class using React (built with Vite).
It includes small assignments and mini projects such as Tic-Tac-Toe, several DIY exercises, and more.

By browsing through this repository, you can see examples of:

React Router

Props lifting up

Listing and rendering

State management

React Hooks

And other essential React features

The repository also showcases our final project, the Material Mini Project, which is accessible through the UI. While some parts of the UI may not be perfect in terms of UX üòÖ, the focus for the Material project was on writing clean and functional code rather than styling.

## üìÑ Pages detail
The Material Project is the official final assignment, but I wanted to showcase everything I practiced in my Vite React app. <br>
For clarity, I‚Äôve added a short explanation of each page below.

### 01_tictactoe
- A basic exercise when I first started React with Vite
- A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game
- Mainly practiced importing components

### 02_material
- ‚≠ê final project
- A game where you guess the first letter of an item based on its picture
- Applied everything I learned: routing, Material UI, components, hooks, etc.

### 03_count
- A simple exercise given by Drew near the end of the course
- Pressing ‚Äú-‚Äù or ‚Äú+‚Äù updates the initial value (0) by -1 or +1
- Practiced using `onClick` functions in buttons

### 04_response
- Event handler exercises from the official React documentation
- Built various functional button components
- Focused on passing variables and functions as props to child components

### 05_conditional_list_state
- Another exercise given by Drew near the end of the course
- Practiced useState, conditional rendering, and list handling
- Used `map()` to create a list and controlled its open/close state with a boolean in `useState`

### 06_hooks0910
- Class content from September 10
- Practiced using Material UI components
- Built a stopwatch and an increment counter using `useState` and `useEffect`

### 07_hooks0911
- Class content from September 11
- Practiced using createContext and how to apply it
- Learned that `provider` requires a `value`
- Found using `useContext` more convenient than `consumer`

<!-- ## Exercise 01: Router, Forms, Lifting State Up
- React Router ‚Üí Implemented in App.jsx for navigation between pages.

- Forms ‚Üí Built a controlled form inside 07_DIY0911.jsx.

- Lifting State Up ‚Üí Shared parent state with props across most of the 7 page components. -->
