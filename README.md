# React application using Vite <img src='public\vite.svg' style="width:30px; height:auto; vertical-align: -15%;">

This project is a collection of all the exercises and projects I worked on during class using React (built with Vite).
It includes small assignments and mini projects such as Tic-Tac-Toe, several DIY exercises, and more.

By browsing through this repository, you can see examples of:

React Router

Props lifting up

Listing and rendering

State management

React Hooks

And other essential React features

The repository also showcases our final project, the Material Mini Project, which is accessible through the UI. While some parts of the UI may not be perfect in terms of UX ðŸ˜…, the focus for the Material project was on writing clean and functional code rather than styling.
