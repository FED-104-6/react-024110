# React application using Vite <img src='public\vite.svg' style="width:30px; height:auto; vertical-align: -15%;">
Just for practice :) <br>

I'm doing some exercises which help me improve my front-end skills by using the official React site that Drew recommended us on Teams.

## ðŸš€ How to run
```bash
0. git clone <repo-url>
1. Install dependencies:
    npm install
2. Start the development server:
    npm run dev
3. Open the provided local URL in your browser.
    usually http://localhost:5173
```

## Exercise 01: Router, Forms, Lifting State Up
1. **React Router**
   - Navigation between Home and About pages.
   --> I did with App.jsx
2. **Forms**
   - Controlled input form that updates state on change.
   --> I did with 07_DIY0911.jsx
3. **Lifting State Up**
   - Shared state managed in the parent and displayed across multiple child components.
   --> I did with almost every jsx page
